This guide shows how to wrap an AutoMLStep in a PythonScriptStep to quickly iterate on AutoML experiments. Some benefits include:
* Very straight and self-serve to run, especially as teams iterate on many features / minor changes to dataset
* Can be integrated with pipelines and orchestrator scripts very easily
* Supports train + validation datasets
* Once the pipeline is published, the submit option has a nice UI wizard to run AutoML with different parameters
